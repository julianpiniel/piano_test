Coding test for Piano

There are two folders, each one containing the code assestment in different languages. 
<br/>
<br/>
# Js
For the first solution I chose JavaScript with Node.Js as it is one of my main strengths. I used fast-csv library to write the output file, Axios for the http request, and dotenv to manage environmental variables.
<br/>
<br/>
# Py
Second solution was implemented in Python as required. I used python-decouple to manage environmental variables and "requests" library for the http request. Used a virtual environment with pipenv command.
<br/>
<br/>

# Disclaimer
Csv files and the .env file were included in the .gitignore file,as they may have sensitive information.You will not see them on folder.
<br/>
<br/>
In order to try this code, you must create 'A.csv','B.csv' and '.env' files providing the right credential and information. ( You can find them at the assestment .doc file)
